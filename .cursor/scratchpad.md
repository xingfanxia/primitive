# GPU-Accelerated Primitive Image Generation

## Current Task
Converting the Go-based primitive algorithm to Python with GPU acceleration for M-series Macs using Metal Performance Shaders (MPS).

## Implementation Plan
1. [X] Create basic project structure
2. [X] Set up GPU acceleration with PyTorch and MPS
3. [X] Implement core image representation and manipulation
4. [X] Implement shape classes (triangle, rectangle, ellipse, etc.)
5. [X] Create the Differential Evolution algorithm for shape optimization
6. [X] Implement parallelized shape evaluation on GPU
7. [X] Add command-line interface
8. [X] Create visualization and output generation
9. [ ] Optimize performance and memory usage
10. [ ] Add tests and documentation

## Progress
- Created new branch `gpu-accelerated-python`
- Set up initial directory structure
- Implemented PyTorch MPS GPU acceleration module
- Created Shape classes (Triangle, Rectangle, Ellipse)
- Implemented Differential Evolution optimizer
- Created main model class with image processing
- Added CLI with argument parsing
- Implemented SVG, PNG, and GIF output formats
- Added detailed README

## Decisions and Findings
- Using PyTorch with MPS backend for GPU acceleration
- Replacing hill climbing with differential evolution algorithm for better parallelization
- Focusing on tensor operations for maximum GPU utilization
- Maintaining compatibility with original CLI arguments
- Using object-oriented design for better modularity

## Next Steps
1. Test the implementation with real images
2. Profile performance and optimize bottlenecks
3. Add support for more shape types
4. Enhance documentation with examples and benchmarks
5. Add comprehensive unit tests

## Previous Tasks

### AI Digest Bot Implementation

*This section contains historical information about completed tasks. Reference as needed but focus on current tasks above.*

#### Project Overview
Building an AI-powered digest bot that:
1. Fetches tweets from X (Twitter) using their API
2. Scrapes web content (future phase)
3. Generates digest summaries using OpenAI
4. Posts drafts to Slack for review

#### Tech Stack
- Next.js + TypeScript
- X API v2 (using node-twitter-api-v2)
- Vercel AI SDK for OpenAI integration
- Supabase for data storage
- Slack API for notifications
- Winston for structured logging
- cli-progress for progress bars

#### Implementation Plan

##### Phase 1: X Integration & Data Fetching ✅
[X] Setup Next.js project with TypeScript
[X] Configure project structure
[X] Install required dependencies
[X] Create type definitions
[X] Implement X API wrapper with rate limiting
[X] Create environment variables setup
[X] Add test script for X API integration
[X] Test and validate X API integration
[X] Setup Supabase schema and integration
[X] Implement tweet caching
[X] Fix Supabase integration and make caching required
[X] Test and validate caching functionality

##### Phase 2: AI Digest Generation
[X] Setup OpenAI integration via Vercel AI SDK
[X] Design prompt for digest generation
[X] Implement digest generation logic
[✓] Add error handling and retry mechanisms
[✓] Add tests and validation
[ ] Optimize token usage

##### Phase 3: Logging & Monitoring ✅
[X] Setup Winston logger
[X] Create logger module with appropriate transports
[X] Integrate logger into digest generation process
[X] Add performance tracking with timers
[X] Test logging functionality
[X] Implement progress bars with Winston integration
[X] Integrate progress bars into individual scripts
[X] Add progress bars to test scripts (test-rss, test-x-api)
[X] Add progress bars to Financial Express scripts
[X] Test and validate progress bars in all scripts

##### Phase 4: Slack Integration
[ ] Setup Slack API integration
[ ] Implement digest posting to Slack
[ ] Add interactive components for review

#### Progress Bar Implementation
- Created a `WinstonProgressTracker` class that integrates with Winston logger
- Implemented progress bars in individual scripts rather than just the main script
- Added detailed progress tracking for each step of the process
- Integrated structured logging with progress updates
- Ensured clean console output by managing stdio inheritance
- Added proper error handling and status updates
- Integrated progress bars into test scripts and Financial Express scripts
- Successfully tested all scripts with progress bars

#### Rate Limit Considerations
- Basic plan: 15 requests per 15 minutes
- Implemented:
  - Request counting
  - Window tracking
  - Automatic rate limit checking
  - Basic error handling
  - OAuth 2.0 Application-Only auth for higher limits
  - Cache results to minimize API calls
  - Required database caching
  - Fixed cache expiry logic
- To implement:
  - Request queuing
  - Cache cleanup job

#### Logging Strategy
- Console logs for development with colorized output
- File logs for production with JSON format
- Separate error logs for critical issues
- Performance tracking with timers
- Structured metadata for better analysis
- Progress bars for long-running operations
- Sentry integration planned for production

### Solana Integration Fix

#### Task Overview
Fix the issue with the `getTrendingTokens` tool call in the Solana Agent Kit integration.

#### Root Cause
The `elfa_trending_tokens` tool in the Solana Agent Kit expects no parameters, but was being called with parameters, causing a schema validation error.

#### Implementation
1. Replaced Solana Agent Kit with direct CoinGecko API calls
2. Added realistic fallback data for when the API calls fail
3. Enhanced the UI to display more information about trending tokens
4. Updated the test script to better handle and report on the fallback data

### Script Directory Organization

#### Task Overview
Organize the `/scripts` directory into a more maintainable structure by categorizing scripts based on their functionality.

#### Implementation
- Created categories: db, fetch, digest, test, utils
- Moved scripts to appropriate directories
- Updated import paths in all moved files
- Updated package.json scripts to reflect new file locations
- Created README files to document the directory structure
